### Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment when running this script. Run the following commands in the root directory of the project.
```
python3 -m venv <env-folder-name>
```

To activate that virtual environment, use the below command:
```
source <env-folder-name>/bin/activate
```

After activating, to install the dependencies run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### File Structure
`Reports` holds all grade reports. The target directory is hardcoded in `utils.py`.

`utils.py` holds a utilities to help with scraping.

`scraper.py` is the actual script. To run it, use the below command:
```
python scraper.py
```
